# Material Icons Pack

Basic light and dark icons for use anywhere in your project.

## Introduction

The icons follow the standard structure of Volantis icon packs and can be swapped out with other icon packs in most
Volantis GUI-based applications.

The icons are split into "light" and "dark" variants. Light variants are meant to show on a dark background, and dark variants are meant to show on a light background.

Within the color variants, the icons are split into option folders for different uses:

- The 1x and 2x folders contain PNG icons in two standardized sizes. When requesting an icon in a larger size (e.g. 3x), the largest available size will be used.
- The svg folder contains the SVG version of the icon. This can be scaled to any size and serves as a source for the PNG icons.
